Hyperbole
	1.	Manipulate common ground (uncertainty over priors)
	2.	Hyperbole and quantifiers ("I ate all the cookies." "I ate none of the cookies.")
	3.	Degrees of affect instead of binary
	4.	Going the extra million miles (why say "a million" when "a thousand" is equally hyperbolic?)
	5.	Going the extra million and one miles (snarkiness effect: paying extra cost to say something clearly hyperbolic)
	6.	Hyperbole in more abstract domains (time instead of price, something less clearly observable)
	7.	Sarcasm (when affect goes the other direction)
	8.	Humorous effects of hyperbole
	9.	Does using hyperbole draw speaker and listener closer?
Metaphor
	1.	QUD for all features, not just first feature
	2.	Alternative utterances (eliciting animals with complementary features)
	3.	What communicative goals are metaphors ideally suited to satisfy that literal utterances are not
	4.	Quantify the additional information value of metaphors
	5.	Using metaphor to avoid saying "no" (politeness, appropriateness)
	6.	Hyperbolic effects of metaphor ("He is a dinosaur.")
	7.	Humorous effects of metaphor
