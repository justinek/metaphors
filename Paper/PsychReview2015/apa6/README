The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association is
widely used in the social sciences.  The most recent update, in 2009,
altered the formatting guidelines and therefore rendered existing
formatting solutions inadequate.  The apa6 class is an update of
older code from the apa class (available from CTAN), which is no
longer being maintained.  New features have also been added, such as
suppressing references to one's own work to facilitate masked reviews
of manuscripts by independent reviewers.  See the documentation for
details.
